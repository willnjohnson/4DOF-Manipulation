# 4DOF Manipulation (Bakeoff 2)
This project explores improving usability in an iterative (agile) respect.

The goal of 4DOF Manipulation is to have the user intuitively translate, rotate, and scale a user square towards a target square as quickly as possible in 12 trials.

## How to Use
Final Prototype is in directory /Final Prototype.

Click bakeoff4DOF.pde and run it.

## Iterative Design Summary
#### 🛴 Scaffold
* No improvements as this code is provided to us
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f59d1b8a-cb9b-4d35-8e77-c96c164eb31d

#### 🚲 Iteration 1
* Added a user panel with "joysticks" to handle translation, rotation, and scaling
* Added checkbox to proceed to the next trial

#### 🏍️ Iteration 2
* Added visual guides to help with alignment
* Added marching ants "selection" on user square
* Added blinking timer
* Added light up indicators in "joystick" panel
* Made user square turn green when all indicators are correct

#### 🚗 Final Iteration
* Made user square fill transparent when dragged to help reduce occlusion of elements behind the square
* Added an ellipse handle to do both resizing and rotating
* Made background darker to improve visuals
